<h2>Play</h2>
<p>Players take turns in clockwise order.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Other standard rules (moving, stacking, winning condition) apply.</p>
<p>However, all moves that would result in an instant win for the <b>next</b> player are not available. These can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>suicide moves, in which the current player builds an opponent 5-stack</li>
  <li>moves, which ignore a winning move of the next player</li>
  <li>moves, which enable the next player to win in the next turn</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case where the current player has <b>no move</b> available, the right to move is given back to the <b>previous</b> player, which means effectively the turn order is changed once to anti-clockwise.</p>
